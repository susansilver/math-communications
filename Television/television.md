1. There is a television show you can watch right now. It will entertain you and get you laughing about mathematics. It also happens to be my favorite tv show of all time, **Futurama**.

[Many gags are easy to miss because they appear on screen so briefly.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJDiZi9dqOg) They are often references to mathematics. If you want to see what I mean, watch the episode “The Prisoner of Benda.” The premise is a legit mathematical theorem developed for the episode. Written by a staff writer who was also a mathematician, Ken Keeler. You can [watch it in the US on Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/watch/c4c99ba0-213f-4f8f-9245-edc45c1c4232) (Season 7, Episode 10.)

2. When I was a kid, I would watch Saturday Morning Cartoons. So hard to believe that isn’t a thing anymore. It was during this time that ABC would show **Schoolhouse Rock!** segments. Doing research for this, I discovered that [they did a 50th anniversary special this year](https://abc.com/news/insiderwatch-schoolhouse-rock-50th-anniversary-singalong-abc-app-hulu-disney-plus). You can catch clips on YouTube but [you can stream them all on Disney+](https://www.disneyplus.com/series/schoolhouse-rock/4AbEzzTxhWxZ). This is my favorite song from what they call Multiplication Rock.

3. **SquareOne TV** is a show that aired on my local PBS station when I was a kid. It was a children’s show that was all about mathematics. I was able to learn the rules for adding and subtracting negative numbers by watching it. You can still find clips on YouTube. 

[Here is a playlist of the episodes from the first season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-vPvGoB6YA&list=PLFk84PZ1x_cM49WGDG1sCaial9kFyeUvT)

4. Of course, we cannot forget The Count from **Sesame Street**! This is a children’s show that teaches about numbers and letters. Here is a [40 minute compilation of sketches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnBlIuJdJxE) from different years of the show. 

5. This one comes from over the pond, **QI**. Which stands for Quite Interesting. This is a panel show where contestants don’t guess the right answer. They come up with the most interesting or funny ones. It was originally hosted by Stephen Fry but now it is Sandi Toksvig. The show features many science questions, and of course, mathematics from time to time.
