1. The first one that I want to list is **Stand and Deliver**. I almost forgot about this one but found it when I was doing research. It has an important message about believing in yourself. 

This is what I would tell my younger math anxious self. It matters far less what people think of your abilities. _What matters is what you believe about yourself_. I wish that I had understood that then.

 If you are having a hard time with math, [my emails are open.](mailto:hello+git@susansilver.net) Let’s talk about it. 

2. I would recommend **A Trip to Infinity** which is [a documentary you can watch on Netflix](https://beautyofmathematics.com/a-trip-to-infinity-netflix-documentary-streaming-now/). They do try to explain it in the simplest terms. There are plenty of easter eggs for people who know more. A bit of a spoiler, _some infinities are bigger than others._ ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elvOZm0d4H0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elvOZm0d4H0))
3. **The Man Who Knew Infinity** is about the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. I’ve read the book and enjoyed the movie. It was dream casting with Dev Patel as Ramanujan. Jeremy Irons wasn’t bad as Hardy either but I still think we [need to move away from the idea that he was cold, shy, and awkward.](https://beautyofmathematics.com/truth-hardy/) 
4. I don’t want to leave out **The Dot and the Line**. This cartoon won Best Animated Short Film at the Oscars. It’s based on a story written by Norton Juster (**The Phantom Tollbooth**) and inspired by the book **Flatland.** A good watch for people who like geometry.

5. Well, let’s also put the **Phantom Tollbooth** on this list. Butch Patrick plays Milo. Eddie from **The Munsters**. [Features a dodecahedron](https://thephantomtollbooth.fandom.com/wiki/Dodechahedron) which is a platonic solid with twelve faces. It is also known to Role Players as the D12. 
6. There is the Disney classic, **Donald Duck in Mathmagic Land**. For whatever reason, the segment on billiards is the one that I remember the most.

7. **Hidden Figures** is a wonderful movie. It took way too long for this story to make it to the screen. It tells the story of mathematicians [Katherine G. Johnson](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/katherine-g-johnson), [Dorothy Vaughan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Vaughan), and [Mary Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Jackson_(engineer)). Three black women whose contributions were vital to the early missions of NASA. 
8. I will admit, I have not seen this documentary. I wanted to add it to the list since[ it is about the first woman to win the Fields Medal, Maryam Mirzakhani](http://www.zalafilms.com/secrets/). The movie is **Secrets of the Surface**. It is an important story so I don’t mind recommending it sight unseen. [International Women in Mathematics Day](https://may12.womeninmaths.org/) is on May 12th, Mirzakhani’s birthday. She passed away in 2017. 
9. One documentary that I really liked was **Between the Folds** which is about origami. Paper folding often takes on modular and geometric forms, making it great for math art. There is a history of studying the subject in mathematics.

10. This movie is not for kids. If you don’t mind a story that gets dark, then you might like **Pi**. Described as a psychological thriller. I’m not sure if this is exactly a math movie. Though numbers are essential to the plot. I put [some math songs on my playlist](https://beautyofmathematics.com/math-love-songs/) that only feature numbers. So I am going to include this one.
