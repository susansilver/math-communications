# Meet the Storytellers Who Bring Mathematics to Life

## Description

My friend asked me if mathematics communication existed. My reaction was vicereal. Tense and on the defensive, I realized that I was over reacting. So I calmed down before responding. I replied with a few Tweets highlighting some of my favorite mathematical storytellers.

In my response, there was no way to mention everything out there. I complied this list as a way to give credit to everyone. Resources that I've collected from over a decade of unabashedly revelng in my love mathematics. To my surpise the list begun to grow to more than 100 links! 

I have since realized that this no longer just a list. It is a passion project. If you have any reccomendations, [send them my way](mailto:hello+git@susansilver.net).

I feel that this project can solve three problems:
- Provide an entryway into mathemathtics for the cuious
- Connect people in science communications
- Give teachers and parents ways to help children when they are struggling with math.
